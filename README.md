# flora-relief
Ancient WordPress theme

Somebody asked about updating this theme on the WordPress forums. See [this topic] (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/found-a-translation-function-that-is-missing-a-text-domain-2?replies=6).

It is not even in the wordpress.org theme repository any more, but using a bit of google-fu, I managed to find a copy in the WordPress Subvesion repository [here](http://themes.svn.wordpress.org/flora-relief/).

I cannot find any information about the authors, and their [website](http://designer-relief.com) seems to have disappeared.

I decided to try updating it in my spare time to see how difficult this is to do.
